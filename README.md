# A simple way to punish scammers!
You can use this punish phising sites out there and spam their data with fake data!<br>
This uses POST requests to send the required data to the desired phising site.

Everything necessary can be found in  [main.py](https://github.com/InsrtRandomUserHere/Simple-Scammer-Punisher/blob/main/main.py)
